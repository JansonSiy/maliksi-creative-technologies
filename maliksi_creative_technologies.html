INSTRUCTIONS
Please review the following code snippet and provide a critique of the code.
Make a list of:
(a) problems that you see (from a code correctness, quality and maintainability
standpoint)
(b) a reason for them being a problem
(c) a proposed improvement
We spotted at least 20 trouble spots, so don’t be shy!

ANSWERS
#1
(a) PROBLEM:
Line 1 is missing <!DOCTYPE html>.
(b) REASON:
The declaration of the document type helps browsers display web pages properly.
It is an instruction to the web browser on what version of HTML the page is written in.
(c) PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
Simple put <!DOCTYPE html> on line 1.

#2
(a) PROBLEM:
This line main .header h1 { margin: 16px; }
(b) REASON:
Code is not readable. Not following proper structure/format.
(c) PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
Line should be like below.
main, .header, h1 {
margin: 16px;
}
Elements, classes and ids should be separated by comma and proper spacing should
be observed for other developers who'd read it.

The main issue is that main .header could mean or be the same as main.header. In
code it translates as <main class="header">.
Basing on the given code in the <body>, specifically here:
<main>
<div class="header">
<div> has the class="header", not <main>. The design will not push through if it's
intended there.

#3
(a) PROBLEM:
Inconsistent grouping in CSS & reusing of same style.
(b) REASON:
It doesn't look good, not organized but it is still functional.
(c) PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
Simple grouping of styles, like for font-size: 16px;
Example:
body, form, input, .input {
font-size: 16px;
}

#4
(a) PROBLEM:
Problems with format & syntax with this line form .input { margin: 16px 0; }
(b) REASON:
Code not readable and could easily be misunderstood.
(c) PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
Simple put comma between form and .input. Second fix spacing, lastly clarify margin
style.
margin has a shorthand which is margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px. This is respectively for top,
right, bottom and left. margin: 16px 0; feels incomplete.
Change it to the code below:
form, .input {
margin: 16px;
}

#5
(a) PROBLEM:
The problem is in this line form { padding: 16px; }.
(b) REASON:
padding: 16px; was reused, better to group it with <main> element. Also, formatting
problems.
(c) PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
Change it to the code below:
form, main {
padding: 16px;
}

#6
(a) PROBLEM:
This line border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(0 0 0 / 15%);
(b) REASON:
The mentioned line is not following parameter structure.
rgba accepts 4 parameters, this is for red, green, blue and opacity (0.0 - fully
transparent) and 1.0 - not transparent at all).
Lastly no "/", no "%".
(c) PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
Change it to the code below:
.header {
border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1);
}

#7
(a) PROBLEM:
This line below
form .input input,
form [type="submit"] {
(b) REASON:
Did not follow proper format again to avoid confusion.

Since <form> doesn't have a class="input" there should be a comma separating
elements and classes.
(c) PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
Change it to the code below:
form, .input, input, form [type="submit"] {

#8
(a) PROBLEM:
This line width: 100%; height: 2em;
(b) REASON:
Wrong structuring of code.
(c) PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
Just simply fix it to:
width: 100%;
height: 2em;

#9
(a) PROBLEM:
This line line-height: 2em;
(b) REASON:
Wrong usage of line-height. It's commonly used to set the distance between lines of
text.
I don't see the need for it here.
(c) PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
Just simply delete it.

#10
(a) PROBLEM:
This line padding: 0 10px;
(b) REASON:
Confusing padding style.
(c) PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
padding has the same shorthand as margin's. Top, right, bottom, left respectively.

0 should be removed instead of doing padding: 0px 10px 0px 0px; or specifically
declare padding-right: 10px.

#11
(a) PROBLEM:
This line:
[type="submit"] {
border: 1px solid #aaa;
background-color: #add8e6;
cursor: pointer;
}
(b) REASON:
Designs are overlapping, might as well just use one of which.
(c) PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
Remove either [type="submit"] or form [type="submit"] design.

#12
(a) PROBLEM:
This line:
main {
position: absolute;
top: 50%; left: 50%;
(b) REASON:
Wrong formatting again.
(c) PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
Change to:
main {
position: absolute;
top: 50%;
left: 50%;

#13
(a) PROBLEM:
This line:
main {
position: absolute;
top: 50%; left: 50%;
background-color: white;

(b) REASON:
Overlapping background-color design. Initially, <main> was given background-color:
#f0f0f0; .
Now, another background-color is being passed through.
(c) PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
Just remove the overlapping design.

#14
(a) PROBLEM:
This line:
box-shadow: 0 3px 5px -1px rgb(0 0 0 / 20%),
0 5px 8px 0 rgb(0 0 0 / 14%),
0 1px 14px 0 rgb(0 0 0 / 12%);
(b) REASON:
Color is not being read because it lacks comma for the rgb.
(c) PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
Simply add commas in between colors.
box-shadow: 0 3px 5px -1px rgb(0, 0, 0, 20%),
0 5px 8px 0 rgb(0, 0, 0, 14%),
0 1px 14px 0 rgb(0, 0, 0, 12%);

#15
(a) PROBLEM:
CSS and JavaScript are internally linked.
(b) REASON:
CSS and JavaScript should be externally linked. That’s the best practice.
(c) PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
Add the below in the <head> and paste the CSS and JS code in the newly created files.
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style_name.css">
<script src="js_name.js" defer></script>

#16
(a) PROBLEM:
<button type="submit" id="submit">Login</button>
(b) REASON:
type="submit" and JS function are overlapping.

(c) PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
change type from type=”submit” to type="button"

#17
(a) PROBLEM:
This section in <script></script>
function login(event){
event.stopPropagation();
(b) REASON:
Passing the event in the parameter login() won't be needed as I recommend to delete
event.stopPropagation();
If I understood it correctly, event.stopPropagation(); stops incoming events after this
event.
I believe there is no need for it.
(c) PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
Clean up code, change it to:
function login(){

#18
(a) PROBLEM:
This section in <script></script>
let user = document.getElementById('user');
let pass = document.getElementById('pass');
localStorage.setItem('user', user.value);
localStorage.setItem('pass', pass.value);
(b) REASON:
First, I would not recommend saving the username and password in the localStorage.
Second, I prefer to put .value in the variable, it looks cleaner to me.
Example: let user = document.getElementById('user').value;
(c) PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
If it were up to me, I would delete this block.
Other than the reason mentioned above, since after the API fetch, you would also save
it in the localStorage. It becomes redundant.

#19
(a) PROBLEM:
This section in <script></script>
let submit = document.getElementById('submit');
submit.addEventListener('click', login);
&
<button type="submit" id="submit">Login</button>
(b) REASON:
I believe there is a way to shorten the code.
(c) PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
STEP 1 - delete the code below
let submit = document.getElementById('submit');
submit.addEventListener('click', login);
STEP 2 - after revising the button type, add an onclick function. Like this.
<button type="button" id="submit" onclick="login()">Login</button>
